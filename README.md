# Poker POC

## Approach

This is a "naive" or "basic" poker hand evaluator. I only added simple optimizations like memoizing methods. I mainly focused on clean code, test coverage, and accuracy.

If a highly efficient evaluator were desired, I would probably use [The Two Plus Two Evaluator](https://www.codingthewheel.com/archives/poker-hand-evaluator-roundup/#2p2).
## Assumptions

- 52 Card Deck
- 2 Players

## TODO

- Deal with ties better. I think the evaluator handles most ties except a Royal Flush tie, but the presentation doesn't address ties at all.
